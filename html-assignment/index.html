        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Hemandh, I am 21 years old and I like to sleep a lot, kinda lazy. I play a lot of video games, procrastinate a lot and I like football, Ronaldo fan here, I do drink coffee and tea but not an addict. I spent unhealthy amount of time watching anime and reading manga. My favourite anime is <abbr title="Attack On Titan"> AOT </abbr> and the manga I like the most is Berserk. </p>

                When I was in 6<sup>th</sup> grade I had this dream of becoming a software Engineer, and as I grew up, well...<em>reality isn't that easy</em>. Coding was not meant for me. Little by little my love for being an software engineer stopped. Yet, I wanted to learn about Computers. I did work on my personal computer here and there. I am hoping pursue a career in IT field. I do watch a lot of techy Videos and stuff. <blockquote>Efficiency is Clever Laziness -<cite>David Dunham</cite></blockquote>
